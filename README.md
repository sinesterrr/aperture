## ✨ Overview

**SAMAURA** is a clean, modern Jellyfin client built with **Vite+React.js** — designed for speed, simplicity, and elegance.  
It builds upon the solid foundation of **[Finetic](https://github.com/AyaanZaveri/finetic)** while introducing extended functionality and removing unnecessary complexity.

Special Thanks to **[@AyaanZaveri](https://github.com/AyaanZaveri)**, this is based on his work on finetic, but I am building it upon my personal preferences.

### 🔹 What’s New in SAMAURA

- **Simplified Experience** – Removed AI dependencies for a faster, lighter client, as I personally would not use them at all.
- **Migrated to Vite** - The Entire Project is migrated into Vite + React, since Vite is much faster than webpack and we dont really need SSR features for an application like this.
- **Collections Support** – Full integration for browsing and playing box sets
- **Live TV (WIP)** – Live TV currently works partially, Channels populate but a guide and programs page must be integrated.
- **Improved Navigation & Performance** – Cleaner architecture and optimized loading
- **Theming Enhancements** – Liquid Glass like Theme coming soon
- **Using Tauri instead of Electron** – Now native apps will be based on tauri for better performance, especially with Vite + React + Tauri

- **🔹Now Supports Direct Play🔹** – Now the urls can be played by both transcoding as well as direct streaming.
